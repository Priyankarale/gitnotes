Branching(create branch,push to remote and delete)
create a feature branch from master
===>git branch feature_branch
git checkoutut feature_branch
or git checkoutut -b branchName
add new files into it
===>mysecondfile.txt
push them to master
===>git push oirigin -u feature_branch
merge them to master
===>
delete local branch
delete remote branch

How to create local branch
git branch userReg
git branch --list
when you are creating a feature branch from  the master,whatever you have on master
that is also present on the  feature branch
to switch that branch --->git checkoutut userReg
git push origin -u branchName

to merge to feature branch to master we should be on master branch
git checkoutut master

git merge feature_branch(they are still in local repository (git merge featurebar
branchName))
to see on remote use git push

when we are working in the company u have create a pull request and add reviewer
